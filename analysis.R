# prop to analyze: 3 straight scores by either team. 
# note I am assuming this does not require scores on three straight POSSESSIONS.

# then team A scores, team B does not score, and finally team A scores a third time.

odds <- c(-201, 150)

dec_odds <- odds.us2dec(odds)

# add vig -- the profit or tax imposed by the sports book -- and overround
# This assumes no draws and that the overround is even distributed between the yes and no bet.
# vig  and the overrorund are related mathematically by the following 2 equations:
# 1) overround = (2vig - 1)/(1 - vig) 
# 2) vig = (overround - 1)/overround
# explainer here: https://www.matterofstats.com/what-is-vig-and-overround

# So, for this bet to be positive expected value, we would need to estimate that
# the true probability of either team scoring three times in a row is +/- 6.3%
# from the implied probability of 66.8% to break even on the wager

# get play by play data to calculate % of drives ending in a score
# goal is to get a global base rate for all teams for reg and post-season.
# Then we'll look at just the post-season.
# And finally we'll calculate it using only teams with similar odds as 
# the Chiefs and Eagles, which is currently Eagles -1.5 (-110) Chiefs 1.5 (-110)
# with an over/under of 50 points scored
